I just created this repository to do a certain project called 'ETCH-A-SKETCH'. I hope this won't take long regardless of me not knowing what kind of project I'll be doing. My current skills are not that of a professional, but I know how to create a repo, push, pull, merge from Github & create branches. After many trails & errors I finally created my first game, 'Rock, Paper & Scissors'. I'm getting used to js challenges but there's still long to go. I can honestly say projects are absolutely new to me.
